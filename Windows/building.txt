NOTICE:
HWSDL-win32 may not run at all for you.
However, aaron has successfully compiled and played HWSDL-win32 revision 44 (and up to rev80 something).
nova has only compiled HWSDL, he hasn't gotten it so far as to load into the menu.

//requirements
> libsdl 1.2.11
> ddraw.lib, only. if don't have then see *1.
or download some version of the DirectX sdk (dx9 sdk is around 158mb)

//notes
> if HW_Data environment variable is defined, all you need in the same dir as the exe are the librgl*.dll's.
Devstats/etc will be found via HW_Data. 
> librglsw.dll project is not available currently, so if you do not have this DLL,
see *1.
> if you don't have librgl*.dll's then download librgl* files from *1
> if you get link errors referencing Direct3D, DirectDraw, etc, then download the small dx9 sdk package from *1
