----------

//requirements
> MS visual c++ 2003/7 or 2005/8 (vc8) (2005 express is free) or Mingw*2 using Msys or Cygwin
> libsdl 1.2.11
> ddraw.lib, only. if don't have then see *1.
or download some version of the DirectX sdk (dx9 sdk is around 158mb)

//notes
> compile HWSDL using either the "debug" or "release+symbols" project. You can try "Release" but it probably won't run for you (it does compile).
> kas2c isn't automatically run to generate the required Mission & Tutorial *.c code files, this should be implemented later.
> if HW_Data environment variable is defined, all homeworld data will be found from the directory it specifies. 

//compilers tested
vc7.1 sp1 & vc7.1
vc8 pro sp1 beta & RTM *3

//OS tested for compiling & running
windows XP Pro SP2

//vc8 notes
> if you find that your vc8 compiled hwsdl exe won't run on a different machine, you may need this:
Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable Package (x86)
http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=32BC1BEE-A3F9-4C13-9C99-220B62A191EE&displaylang=en
see "related downloads" below on that page for x64 versions.

//troubleshooting
> if you get link errors referencing Direct3D, DirectDraw, etc, then download the small dx9 sdk package from *1

*1 see:
http://homesource.nekomimicon.net/sourceforum/viewtopic.php?t=100

*2: Mingw build option isn't actively maintained by anyone yet, so it might not build or run for you.

*3: vc8 is using a temporary .big file search code workaround (so files can be found inside the .big files)).
File.obj and BigFile.obj compiled from vc7 will be linked against automatically. Don't compile File.c & BigFile.c using vc8 unless you aren't using .big files (eg: you extracted all data from the .big files as mentioned in readme.txt).
